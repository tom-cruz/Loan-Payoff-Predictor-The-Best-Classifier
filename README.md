# Loan Payoff Predictor: The Best Classifier
Build and evaluation of machine learning classificiation models to best predict whether a loan case will be paid off or not

## Description
This project is intended to showcase the process of finding the appropriate machine learning classifier model for a historical dataset of previous loan applicaitons. Classification algorthims which will be built and tested include k-Nearest Neighbour, Decision Tree, Support Vector Machine, and Logistic Regression. The meetrics for evaluating the models will consisit of the jaccard index, F1-score, and logloss. This project will be follwoing the parts of the Data Science Methodology, which incorporates data collection, data understanding, data preparation, modeling, and evaluation - other components of the methodology will be considered out of scope for the purpose of this project.
